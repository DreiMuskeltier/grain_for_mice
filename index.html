        <h2>How can I help?</h2>
        <p>
          The most effective way to help is to give the grain directly to the mice. Before you say that it's hard to locate the mice, hear me out! They usually build their colonies around the fields of grain. Smart, eh? But the problem is that the mice are very small and the wheat and co. is very tall. So they have to wait until the grains fall which mostly only happens during/after the harvest. On one side they can starve until the harvest comes, on the other hand they can die during the
          harvest if they aren't careful enough (which is hard when you're hungry).<br />Instead of spending time with looking for the mice, you can just leave the grain directly around and in the wheat fields. The mice will find it and they will be very thankful. With their bellies full they don't have to risk their lives during the harvest and there will be no widowed mice and crying children. Just think about it... It feels nice, doesn't it.

      <h3>Corn for Mice!</h3>
      <p>Mice they like corn 'cause it's nice<br />They would wade through rain and through ice<br />To get to the corn, they look quite forlorn<br />'Cause having no corn is not nice.</p>
